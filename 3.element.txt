What is an XML Element? An XML element is everything from (including) the element's start tag to (including) the element's
end tag.
<price>29.99</price>

An element can contain: text attributes other elements or a mix of the above

<bookstore>
    <book category="children">
        <title>Harry Potter</title>
        <author>J K. Rowling</author>
        <year>2005</year>
        <price>29.99</price>
    </book>
    <book category="web">
        <title>Learning XML</title>
        <author>Erik T. Ray</author>
        <year>2003</year>
        <price>39.95</price>
    </book>
</bookstore>

In the example above:

<title>, <author>, <year>, and <price> have text content because they contain text (like 29.99).
<bookstore> and <book> have element contents, because they contain elements.
<book> has an attribute (category="children").
