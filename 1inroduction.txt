# XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language.

# XML was designed to store and transport data.

# XML was designed to be both human- and machine-readable.

// example 1
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<note>
  <to>Tove</to>
  <from>Jani</from>
  <heading>Reminder</heading>
  <body>Don't forget me this weekend!</body>
</note>

The XML above is quite self-descriptive:

It has sender information.
It has receiver information
It has a heading
It has a message body.

But still, the XML above does not DO anything. XML is just information wrapped in tags.
Someone must write a piece of software to send, receive, store, or display it:

The Difference Between XML and HTML
XML and HTML were designed with different goals:

XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

XML Does Not Use Predefined Tags  

The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.

HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.

With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.

XML Simplifies Things

It simplifies data sharing
It simplifies data transport
It simplifies platform changes
It simplifies data availability
