XML Attributes

XML elements can have attributes, just like HTML.
Attributes are designed to contain data related to a specific element.

Attribute values must always be quoted. Either single or double quotes can be used.
For a person's gender, the <person> element can be written like this:
<person gender="female">

XML Attributes for Metadata
Sometimes ID references are assigned to elements. These IDs can be used to identify XML elements in much the same way as the id attribute in HTML
